ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
imgopt is a console application for down-scaling large images to a more suitable
format for digital publishing - web, presentations and what not. 

By default the max size of images is 1280x1024 pixels, but this can be changed
by the --width (-w) and --height (-h) flags.

By default directories isn't scanned recursively but with the --recurse (-r)
flag sub directories will also be scanned.

The program takes both images and directories as argument. It will discart 
images that doesn't need to be down scaled. TIFF and BMP images will be 
converted to JPEG images and all images being down scaled will get the postfix
-lowres appended to the file name. So "my-large-image.jpg" will get a copy
named "my-large-image-lowres.jpg" which will be put in the same directory
as the original


INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	
should do it.


USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most simple way of using is imgopt is by just calling it:

	user@comp:~$ imgopt
	
	which will scan the current directory for large images.
	
You can call the program with a single image as argument:

	user@comp:~$ imgopt Images/my-image.jpg
	
	which will down scale "Images/my-image.jpg" to a maximum size of
	1280x1024 pixels. A copy named "Images/my-image-lowres.jpg" will be created.

You can also specify the max width and/ot height:

	user@comp:~$ imgopt -w 800 -h 600 Images/my-image.jpg
	
You can also call the program with multiple arguments, mixing both images
and directories

	user@comp:~$ imgopt my-image.jpg my-second-image.jpg Images/higres 
	
If you want to do recursive scanning of images add the -r flag

	user@comp:~$ imgopt -r Images/
