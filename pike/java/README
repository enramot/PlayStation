An example of how to use the Java binding in Pike.

Make sure Java's CLASSPATH has a pointer to the current directory.

Run `make` to compile the Java class. Then simply run the Pike script

Note! If you wan't to use Java classes in a JAR file it seems you explicitly
need to add the JAR to your CLASSPATH for Pike to find it.

Note! In Swedish Java is slang for coffee, and coffee in Swedish is kaffe, 
hence the Pike module Kaffe.pmod ;)
